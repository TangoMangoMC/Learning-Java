I made a basic Java calculator via a YouTube Tutorial! 
Code:
package tyler;
import java.util.Scanner;

class apples{
	public static void main (String args[]) {
		Scanner tyler = new Scanner (System.in);
		double fnum,snum, answer;
		System.out.println("Enter first num: ");
		fnum = tyler.nextDouble();
		System.out.println("Enter second num: ");
		snum = tyler.nextDouble();
		answer = fnum + snum;
		System.out.println(answer);
		
	}
}

I called it apples as the YouTube tutorial did, and it helped as I knew it was the 'title'.
